  album: "Out of the Blue",
  artist: "Electric Lights Orchestra",
  year: 1977,
  lyrics: "Sun is shinin' in the sky
  There ain't a cloud in sight
  It's stopped rainin' everybody's in the play
  And don't you know
  It's a beautiful new day, hey hey
  Runnin' down the avenue
  See how the sun shines brightly in the city
  On the streets where once was pity
  Mr. Blue Sky is living here today, hey hey
  Mr. Blue Sky please tell us why
  You had to hide away for so long (so long)
  Where did we go wrong?
  Mr. Blue Sky please tell us why
  You had to hide away for so long (so long)
  Where did we go wrong?
  Hey you with the pretty face
  Welcome to the human race
  A celebration, Mr. Blue Sky's up there waitin'
  And today is the day we've waited for
  Oh Mr. Blue Sky please tell us why
  You had to hide away for so long (so long)
  Where did we go wrong?
  Hey there Mr. Blue
  We're so pleased to be with you
  Look around see what you do
  Everybody smiles at you
  Hey there Mr. Blue
  We're so pleased to be with you
  Look around see what you do
  Everybody smiles at you
  Mr. Blue, you did it right
  But soon comes Mr. Night creepin' over
  Now his hand is on your shoulder
  Never mind I'll remember you this
  I'll remember you this way
  Mr. Blue Sky please tell us why
  You had to hide away for so long (so long)
  Where did we go wrong?
  Hey there Mr. Blue (sky)
  We're so pleased to be with you (sky)
  Look around see what you do (blue)
  Everybody smiles at you",

  title: "Don't Stop Believin'",
  album: "Escape",
  artist: "Journey",
  year: 1981,
  lyrics: "Just a small town girl
  Livin' in a lonely world
  She took the midnight train going anywhere
  Just a city boy
  Born and raised in South Detroit
  He took the midnight train going anywhere
  A singer in a smokey room
  A smell of wine and cheap perfume
  For a smile they can share the night
  It goes on and on and on and on
  Strangers waitin'
  Up and down the boulevard
  Their shadows searchin' in the night
  Streetlights, people
  Livin' just to find emotion
  Hidin', somewhere in the night
  Workin' hard to get my fill
  Everybody wants a thrill
  Payin' anything to roll the dice
  Just one more time
  Some'll win, some will lose
  Some are born to sing the blues
  Whoa, the movie never ends
  It goes on and on and on and on
  Strangers waitin'
  Up and down the boulevard
  Their shadows searchin' in the night
  Streetlights, people
  Livin' just to find emotion
  Hidin', somewhere in the night
  Don't stop believin'
  Hold on to that feelin'
  Streetlights, people
  Don't stop believin'
  Hold on
  Streetlights, people
  Don't stop believin'
  Hold on to that feelin'
  Streetlights, people",

  title: "Telephone Line",
  album: "A New World Record",
  artist: "Electric Lights Orchestra",
  year: 1976,
  lyrics: "Hello, how are you?
  Have you been alright
  Through all those lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely nights?
  That's what I'd say, I'd tell you everything
  If you'd pick up that telephone
  Yeah, yeah, yeah
  Hey, how're you feelin'?
  Are you still the same?
  Don't you realise the things we did, we did, were all for real?
  Not a dream
  I just can't believe they've all faded out of view
  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
  Ooh-ooh-ooh
  I look into the sky
  (The love you need ain't gonna see you through)
  And I wonder why
  (The little things you planned ain't coming true)
  Oh, oh, telephone line, give me some time
  I'm living in twilight
  Oh, oh, telephone line, give me some time
  I'm living in twilight
  Okay, so no one's answering
  Well, can't you just let it ring a little longer, longer, longer
  Oh, I'll just sit tight
  In shadows of the night
  Let it ring forevermore, oh-woh
  Yeah, yeah, yeah
  I look into the sky
  (The love you need ain't gonna see you through)
  And I wonder why
  (The little things you planned ain't coming true)
  Oh, oh, telephone line, give me some time
  I'm living in twilight
  Oh, oh, telephone line, give me some time
  I'm living in twilight
  Oh, oh, telephone line, give me some time
  I'm living in twilight
  Oh, oh, telephone line, give me some time
  I'm living in twilight",
